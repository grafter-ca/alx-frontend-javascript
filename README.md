# TypeScript Learning Project - ALX Frontend JavaScript

Welcome to the **TypeScript Learning Project** repository!  
This project guides you through mastering TypeScript fundamentals and advanced concepts via practical, incremental tasks.

---

## üìö Project Overview

This project covers key TypeScript skills, including:

- Basic types and variables
- Interfaces, classes, and functions
- DOM manipulation with TypeScript
- Generic types and namespaces
- Declaration merging and ambient namespaces
- Nominal typing (branding types)
- Advanced typing patterns and type guards
- Integration of external libraries with typings

Each task builds on the previous to help you gain real-world TypeScript proficiency.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explain and use TypeScript basic types confidently.
- Define and extend interfaces and classes.
- Write type-safe functions.
- Manipulate the DOM safely with TypeScript.
- Implement and use generic types.
- Organize code using namespaces and declaration merging.
- Integrate external JavaScript libraries using ambient namespaces.
- Apply nominal typing techniques to enforce strict type safety.
- Use type predicates and string literal types effectively.
